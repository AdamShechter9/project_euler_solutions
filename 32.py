Problem 32

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.


Solution
--------
One way would be to multiply x * xxx = xxxxx from 1 * 234 = 56789 to 9 * 876 = 54321
and increase digits to 12 * 345 = 6789 and 98 * 765 = 4321
By generating permutations of string '123456789' we can minimize operations to smallest number.
